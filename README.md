# Automatic-Mopping-Robot
We developed an Automatic Mopping Robot that can operate in both manual and autonomous modes. The robot can be controlled via a mobile application using Bluetooth, allowing easy and wireless operation. To enhance its functionality, an autonomous navigation system has also been integrated, which enables the robot to detect and avoid obstacles automatically.

For obstacle detection, we used three ultrasonic sensors — one facing forward, one on the left, and one on the right. These sensors help the robot identify nearby objects and navigate efficiently in autonomous mode. A latching switch is provided to toggle between Manual Mode and Autonomous Mode as needed.

An optional LCD display is included for displaying real-time commands or debugging information during testing. To improve performance and reduce weight, we used lithium-ion batteries instead of bulky lead-acid batteries, offering higher capacity and compact size. The water flow system is also adjustable, using a glucose drip infusion mechanism to precisely control the amount of water used during mopping.

Overall, this project combines smart automation, Bluetooth control, and efficient power management, resulting in a compact, user-friendly, and effective cleaning robot:-

Added Autonomous Mode

Fixed mop instead of rotating ones

Removed roller and servo motor

Added LCD Display

Used Lithium-ion Batteries instead of lead acid

Used Arduino Nano (cheaper and smaller in size) instead of Uno

Added Water Flow Control
